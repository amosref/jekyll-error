Here are a few issues:

1. Currently there is no way to add a `newline` to a package description. Not even while using markdown. We want to have a spacing between different parts of the description and cannot find a way to do so. 

2. When downloading all files from a project it downloads them according to the original file names. But, if you try to D/L all valid JSON files, the files are named in 2 different ways: All structureDefinitions are named like the original file but anything else is named like the id. This is a very odd convention and feels like a bug. 

3. In one of our files - https://simplifier.net/ilcore/ilcorepatient - the identifier "pna-id" has a pattern. It does not appear in its children in the simplifier even though they should inherit it. 

4. In the same file as number 3: "Identifier(All Slices).system" has a cardinality of 1..1 but the slices do not inherit this cardinality.
